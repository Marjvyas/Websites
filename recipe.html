                        rabri recipe | rabdi recipe | how to make malpua rabdi with step by step photo and video recipe. while there isn’t much steps in preparation of rabri, but it can be time consuming and monotonous. in other words, the milk has to be boiled till it reduces to half and turns thick and creamy. it is also a main ingredients for several dessert recipes like malpua, rasabali, chhena kheeri, and khira sagara.

                        while evaporating the milk, adds some sweetness to rabri milk, but i do recommend to add extra sugar to match the authentic taste. if you do not like extra sugar, then you can totally skip it. also it is added with cardamom powder and saffron for richness and topped with dry fruits like almonds, pistachios. moreover, the same rabri can also be used to make rasmalai dessert recipe.

                        I have made khaman dhokla recipe both with lemon juice and citric acid. Citric acid gives a superb fluffy texture. Lemon juice also works great, but citric acid wins here. That said, use whatever is easily available to you.

                        To swap citric acid with lemon juice, use this standard proportion of:
                        1 tablespoon lemon juice = ¼ teaspoon citric acid (in the powdered form)

                        For citric acid, use a food-grade and pure citric acid. I also suggest including freshly squeezed lemon juice. Use a fresh lemon.

                        Dhokla: <br>
                        2 to 3 pinches of turmeric powder
                        a generous pinch of asafoetida (skip to make a gluten-free version)
                        1.5 tablespoons lemon or lime juice or ⅓ to ½ teaspoon pure citric acid
                        1.5 teaspoons ginger paste (crush 1.5 inch ginger and 1.5 teaspoons green chilies in a mortar-pestle)
                        1.5 teaspoons green chili paste
                        1 tablespoon sugar or add according to taste
                        1 teaspoon salt or add as per taste
                        Tip: Avoid adding too much of turmeric powder as then the fruit salt or baking soda reacts with the turmeric powder and makes it red in color, thereby giving reddish dots, specks or tones in the khaman

                        Rasmalai: <br>
                        Rasmalai balls: To make rasmalai balls the milk is first boiled and and then curdled by adding lemon juice or vinegar. After draining the water from the curdled milk, the protein that is left is called the “chena” or “paneer”. The chena is then mashed till it becomes smooth. Small balls are then made from that chena and dropped in boiling sugar syrup till cooked.


                        The thickened milk or the ras: The rasmalai balls are finally dipped in thickened milk and chilled before serving. To make the “ras” [syrup] full fat milk is boiled till it thickens slightly. It is then flavored with saffron and cardamom.

                        So now that we know what rasmalai is let’s talk a bit about how you can make them perfectly at home. The biggest problem that people face while making rasmalai at home is that the rasmalai balls often turn out hard whereas they should be totally soft and in fact melt in your mouth – that’s when you know you have made the perfect rasmalai. During my trip to India this time I made it so many times that now I feel confident in sharing these little tips which will make sure that your rasmalais turn out perfectly every time.

                        I will talk about these tips as we go through the step by step picture for this recipe

                        

                        Method

                        Boil milk in a heavy bottom pan. Once it comes to a boil, switch off the flame and add 1/2 cup of water to bring the temperature of the milk down a bit. Wait for 5-10 minutes and then start adding lemon juice till milk curdles.

                        Point No.1 : Use full cream/whole milk to make rasmalai. Low fat or fat free will not give good results. The rasmalai balls are nothing but milk fat so you need to use full fat milk for making this sweet.

                        Point No. 2: Don’t curdle the milk as soon as it comes to a boil. Add 1/2 cup water and wait for 5-10 minutes till the milk temperature comes down a bit. If you curdle the milk when it’s not “super hot”, the resulting chena will be softer.


                        Rasmalai-Recipe-Step-1-notitle-cwm

                        Add lemon juice till the milk curdles completely. Using a strainer drain the water and collect the chena. Rinse it under tap water so that there’s no trace of lemon juice in it. Leave it in the strainer for 10-15 minutes and then take the chena in your hand and squeeze out remaining water slowly.

                        Point No. 3: Even though you have to squeeze out the water completely from the chena, make sure that it’s not completely dry. The chena should feel soft and moist even after you have squeezed out the water. So don’t press it too hard else it will become dry and resulting rasmalai balls will not be soft. This step is important so do leave little water in the chena so that it feels soft and moist when you mash it
